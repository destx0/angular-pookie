# Introduction to Angular

Angular is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It's used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and is known for its powerful features and robust ecosystem.

## Key Features of Angular

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular applications are built using components, which are self-contained units of functionality.

2. **TypeScript**: Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.

3. **Two-Way Data Binding**: This feature allows for automatic synchronization of data between the model and the view.

4. **Dependency Injection**: Angular has a built-in dependency injection system, making it easier to develop, understand, and test applications.

5. **Reactive Programming**: Angular integrates with RxJS, enabling reactive programming patterns.

## Getting Started with Angular

To start developing with Angular, you'll need to:

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install the Angular CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
3. Create a new Angular project:
   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-app
   ```
4. Navigate to your project directory and serve the application:
   ```bash
   cd my-angular-app
   ng serve
   ```

This is just a brief introduction to Angular. There's much more to learn about components, services, routing, and other Angular concepts!
